# Grass-Growth-Disaggregation
## Study and development of a deep learning solution for plant growth prediction
### Supervised by Prof. Dr. Nicolas RAGOT and conducted by Seunkam EZRA and Th√©o BOISSEAU - Polytech Tours


## Description:
Implementation of an LSTM algorithm to disaggregate the cumulative annual grass growth to reconstruct the dynamics of the growth over the year using time series describing the climate of the year.

The disaggregation problem can also be seen as a special case of a more general problem: that of estimating individual values from aggregated data. This problem is also frequently encountered in economic applications where statistical data (for example, voting statistics) are known only for groups of people, but not individually. (1)
